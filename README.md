# signUp

This is a part of The Odin Project curriculum. 

It is a simple sample sign Up page to flex my form manipulation and validation 
skills. 

This project;
1. Validates the email of the user
2. Validates the passwords entered by the user - This includes making sure the original 
   and repeated passwords are the same.
